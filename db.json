This was especially so throughout Europe and Australia. A smaller following in America includes much of the hip-hop community, with artists like Gucci Mane and Danny Brown having dropped bars about the sneaker."

The first four styles of KD shoes all had “Zoom” in the title, but by this point, Nike was confident that Durant's name spoke for itself and dropped the moniker. It was also the first time a sub-line called Elite was introduced, which added additional technical updates to the shoe in the postseason."

The first shoe to ever be worn in the NBA with multiple colourways, the OG black and red was originally banned for violating the league's kit policy, and was threatened with a $5,000 fine every game it was worn. The OG's legacy lives on through the Air Jordan 1 Retro, honoring a legend that expanded the game's creative potential and redefined basketball's connection to style and culture."

Combining striking aesthetics with unique performance-enhancing features, Jordan 4s stood out for their triangular support wings and breathable over-molded mesh paneling. The eye-catching design rocketed to instant popularity, bolstered by standout moments on and off the court. His Airness famously hit “The Shot” over Craig Ehlo sporting Jordan 4s, and the shoe makes a memorable appearance in Spike Lee's seminal 1989 film Do the Right Thing."

Nike designer Tinker Hatfield took inspiration from Jordan's biting style, and likening it to an American WWll fighter plane, he designed the Air Jordan 5 with shark-tooth shapes on the midsole, paired with a clear outside. The shoe captured a ferocity truly reminiscent of its relentless muse who was fighting his way to the top of his game."

      "description": "The Air Jordan 11 was originally released by Nike in 1996. Like so many other classic Jordan models, it was designed by legendary Nike footwear designer Tinker Hatfield. The shoe's patent leather mudguard was inspired by the sleekness of dress shoes which, supposedly, was a special request from Michael Jordan. Jordan, ever the showman, wanted his next Air Jordan shoe with the glossy material because he wanted to wear an elegant shoe on the court. It's safe to say that “Tink” delivered."

It was also Adidas' first basketball shoe to be offered in low, mid, and hi-top models. Standing tall with a crisp leather upper, the trefoil logo on the shoe's tongue peers just above its unmistakable strap—making for a timeless look."

In 2011, they came back once more in a number of original colorways that became very popular among NBA stars like Derrick Rose and Dwight Howard, along with a number of blue-blood university programs."

Since then, the silhouette has acted as a favorite on the courts and an impactful force within several subcultures, both in America and across the globe. Nicknamed the “shell tops”, “shell shoes” or “shell toes” due to its iconic rubber shell toe cap, the Superstar has been regarded as one of the main influences in the rise of modern day sneaker culture. Harking back to its very beginnings, Adidas first introduced the Superstars in 1969 as the ultimate on-court sneaker. They were designed to completely revolutionize and change the basketball footwear industry."
