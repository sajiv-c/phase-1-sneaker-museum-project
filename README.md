# Phase 1 Project: The Sneaker Museum
THE SNEAKER MUSEUM:

- This is a simple web application that allows users to browse through and interact with a collection of sneakers. The application is built using JavaScript and makes use of the Fetch API to retrieve sneaker data from a local server running at http://localhost:3000/sneakers.

Before running this web application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to access the web application

- A local server or a development environment to host the web application

Usage:

- Clone the repository or download the source code.

- Ensure that you have a local server up and running and simply open the index.html file in your browser.

- The website focuses on three popular brands: Nike, Air Jordan, and Adidas. Each brand offers four culturally significant sneakers, all well known to the market.

- You should see a menu of sneakers under the logo. Weâ€™ve incorporated multiple EventListeners to each image, so feel free to click on any sneaker to view its details right below the menu.
    
- Each sneaker's details include release year, original color way, creative director, and more.

- You can also add and delete comments under each sneaker by using the comment form at the bottom of the page.
